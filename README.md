# Basic Informational Site

My first Node.js server project for The Odin Project.  
In the refactor of this project, I used Express.js with `app.get()` to handle URL requests and `app.use()` to display a 404 error page for invalid routes.

## Features
- Serves `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact-me.html`, and `404.html`.
- Built using Node.js with the `http` and `fs` modules. (In the refractor I used express js)


## What I Learned
- How to create a server with Node.js.
- Serving different pages based on URL paths.
- Using `fs.readFile` to load HTML files.
- Setting up a basic Express app and implementing routes with `app.get()` and error handling with `app.use()`.
