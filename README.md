# Basic Informational Site

My first Node.js server project for The Odin Project.

## Features
- Serves `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact-me.html`, and `404.html`.
- Built using Node.js `http` and `fs` modules.

## What I Learned
- Creating a server with Node.js.
- Serving different pages based on URL paths.
- Using `fs.readFile` to load HTML files.
